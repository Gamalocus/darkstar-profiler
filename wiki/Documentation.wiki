_The documentation describing how to use and configure the Darkstar Profiler_

= Introduction =

The following classes are the basis of the project for now, read their pages on how to set them up:

*RawDumpListener*: A profile listener that will dump all profiling info to a number of files.

*ProfileViewer*: A GUI application that can display all kinds of statistics about execution based on the profiling data collected into files by the listener.

Currently the profiler is "offline" as it is not connected directly to the Darkstar server. This could in the future be a feature worth considering.

= Configuration =

You can configure the profile RawDumpListener with the following properties in your sgs.properties file.

{{{
# An relative or absolute path to where you want the output of the profiler
# to go. The directory does not need to exist, but it must be possible to 
# create.
# The default is "darkstar_profile_output" which is a relative path, relative
# to the directory from which the server is launched.
com.gamalocus.sgs.profile.listener.RawDumpListener.output_folder=profiling_output_folder

# A long specifying how many milliseconds of profiling data will go into
# each file before creating a new file. When you view the profiling data
# with the viewer it will give you the list of files. 
# The default is 60000 (one minute)
com.gamalocus.sgs.profile.listener.RawDumpListener.max_age=120000
